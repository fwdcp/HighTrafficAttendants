     *     "steam"      the Steam ID of the player
     *     "group"      a group the player is in (if an admin)
     *     "flag"       a flag the player has (if an admin)
     *     "default"    applies to all players
     *
     * The following keys define the limits:
     *     "limit"      the maximum time (in minutes) a player can be playing
     *     "cooldown"   the number of minutes the player will be temporarily banned for (if 0, permanently; if negative, will only be kicked)
